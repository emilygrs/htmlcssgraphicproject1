    <p> 
        PCOS stands for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. It is one of the most common hormonal conditions in women, according to The Hormone Health Network, part of the Endrocrine Society, which is located in Washington, D.C. 

        </p>

    <p> 
        In an August 2019 article by Good Morning America (GMA), Dr. Jennifer Ashton, an OB/GYN, discussed polycystic ovarian syndrome. "Estimates are anywhere from 5% to upwards of 15% of women," she said, in reference to the amount of women affected by this disorder. Regardless of age, PCOS can affect a female that is in her teenage years, as well as someone who is reaching the end of her reproductive years, menopause. "I think in general it can affect three organ systems," Ashton said, in regards to what PCOS affects in a woman's body. 

        "PCOS can affect your period," she explained. "They can be too close together. They can be too far apart. And just for kicks, they can be normal and you can still have PCOS. But I want to emphasize that today, with reproductive technologies, seeing a reproductive endocrinologist, or an REI specialist - women with PCOS can get pregnant." </p>

        <p> The second organ system that PCOS can affect is the metabolic system in a woman's body. "For reasons that are very complicated and not well understood yet, we know that women with PCOS have a five to seven-time increase risk of developing type-2 diabetes later in life," Ashton mentioned. "Good nutrition, fitness are very important. Keeping your weight in a healthy range is really critical if you have PCOS. It can be more difficult for women with PCOS to metabolize carbohydrates, so typically being on a low-carb diet is beneficial for women with PCOS." 
</p>
    <p> 
        The last and third area of the body that is affected is what Ashton deems as "other." "These are usually affects caused by a high testosterone level. So that means acne and excessive body hair. The good news there are tons of treatments for hormonal acne. Topicals, orals, birth control pills, as a class all lower testosterone levels. Over time, they all improve acne. The body hair can be subtle and tricky to diagnose. "In terms of treatment there are so many options," she said. "Creams, lasers, birth control pills, over time will also slow that hair growth."

    </p>


  <p> 
        In order to diagnose a young girl or woman with PCOS, Ashton adds that the diagnosis is based on a number of factors. "Physical exam, the history of the patient. What she'll tell us about her periods, her weight, her skin, and things like that. Blood tests are a very easy way to help complete the picture."


        Also the one thing that Ashton notes is crucial is that a person who would like to be tested for PCOS, can't be on birth control. "That kind of throws off the whole picture. PCOS is also not a routine testing. It's only if a woman is having a particular sign symptom or problem, that we then go looking for it." "
